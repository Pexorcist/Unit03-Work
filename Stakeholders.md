### There's another feature in SWAY, that when you clicking the button at right bottom side on DESIGN (different look), you will be taken to the page with many headers, and when you clicking one of those headers, you will be taken to that page.

# TEST

### I am going to use Opera GX (Gaming browser) & Microsoft Edge browser to test my Digital Portfolio. I went to SWAY and copied link to find out if the link is working and will load the video with images in other browsers without any issues.

COPERA GX - <img src=IMG/OperaGX.png>

MICROSOFT EDGE - <img src=IMG/MicrosfotEdge.png>

### After testing, I can conclude that the link is working in both browsers, video with the images is working and loaded very fast.

# My Digitol Portfolio Shows

### My Portfolio is stylish and suitable to IT companies, because I have writen my college works, skills, achievements & what courses I've done before and everything in details and of course it also explains of how professional & skilled person I am with all my backstory life and works.

# Final Design

### After getting many negative reviews from my peers & tutors, I've decided to fix all of it, by deleting some image(s), add hyperlinks to misunderstandings/unusually words, check grammar errors by using 'Grammarly' app.
