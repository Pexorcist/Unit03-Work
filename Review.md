# PEERS REVIEW ON MY PORTFOLIO

### Mitcheal - It's fine I would just spectate the header that says about me from that college background since the header covers the text It could be like that cause I'm looking at it on phone but idk
|
### Luke - I like how your portfolio states your skills and hobbies very clearly. It is easy to use and not hard to navigate. The colour scheme is nice and simple which makes it look professional however there are some errors with the grammar.
|
### Adam - I like that your portfolio has your skills and activitys listed however the random clown from IT doesnt really make sense, as well there are some grammatical errors which needs to change. As far as i can see there isnt any sign of your unit 13 work which would have demonstated some good skills. other then that the rest is pretty good
|
### Ugnius - your portfolios is good its says a lot about you, the only thing is that there is not much work related stuff there, so you have to add more about work related stuff as this is more like a cv and its aimed at a employer.
|
### Herb - The portfolio looks good so far. It could use a little work double checking some grammar and possibly a different heading photo for a few pages. (I don't think the clown from IT works well these) The information presented is well organised and the structure is pretty good. I don't have much to say about it other than it should have different headers.

# TUTORS REVIEW ON MY PORTFOLIO

### Lisa -  A nice simplistic portfolio, although quite brief. The images you have used bring it to life however, the first image I don't like. I think you should use something other than the college logo.
| 
### Shaun - A really good digital portfolio Patryk, The layout has been well considered and easy to follow. The information you have inserted is good quality and extremely informative. I like the fact that someone with very little technical IT knowledge would find the content useful. I would have liked to have seen some hyperlinks inserted that link the games you enjoy playing to more information: perhaps a wiki page or a YouTube video.

### Nicky - I enjoyed your portfolio very much. I think that the layout has been well thought through and I found your tutorial to be very informative and it has actually taught me something. Your photos are very thought provoking and I am impressed with the work that you have done on them. I think that you could include all of your accomplishments in the about me section, I see that you didn't include your qualification from the uniform services course. Thank you for letting me review it.
