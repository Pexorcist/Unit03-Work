# PEERS REVIEW ON MY PORTFOLIO

### Matthew - It's fine I would just spectate the header that says about me from that college background since the header covers the text It could be like that cause I'm looking at it on phone but idk
|
### Luke - I like how your portfolio states your skills and hobbies very clearly. It is easy to use and not hard to navigate. The colour scheme is nice and simple which makes it look professional however there are some errors with the grammar.
|
### Adam - I like that your portfolio has your skills and activitys listed however the random clown from IT doesnt really make sense, as well there are some grammatical errors which needs to change. As far as i can see there isnt any sign of your unit 13 work which would have demonstated some good skills. other then that the rest is pretty good
